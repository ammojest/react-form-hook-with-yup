This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# React Form Hook with Yup example
This is an example of a multi-step form created with react-form-hooks and uses Yup validation. 

## Why have I created this?
This was a small project to help me understand how react-form-hooks work and how to add validation within a Next Js Application. 

## How to run?

- download repo
- run "yarn install"
- run yarn dev
- go to http://localhost:3000/

## Validation rules

coming soon...
